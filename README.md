# OIBSIP

Oasis Infobyte Internship is a very prestigious opportunity for those looking for internships which offer learning parallely with projects. I had applied for the Data Science Internship and had gotten my offer letter:
 

## PROJECTS
This is a repository consisting of all the projects done under the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship.
This repository consists of the following five projects:
1. IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
2. UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS
3. CAR PRICE PREDICTION
4. EMAIL SPAM DETECTION
5. SALES PREDICTION


## CONCEPTS USED
These projects have been developed using concepts of Data Science, Machine Learning and Data Visualisation.


## WHAT I LEARNT
As part of this internship I have had the opportunity to learn new concepts and get a working knowledge on them. I learnt application of various useful libraries of python such as Pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly and nltk.
This internship has given me the push to venture into the world of data science and implement models for applications such as prediction, detection and data analysis.
