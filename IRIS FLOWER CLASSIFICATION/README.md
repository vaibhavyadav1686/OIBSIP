# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

This was the first task assigned under this internship.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them.


## METHODOLOGY

I will be using Python library pandas for data management, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualisation and sklearn(Sci-kit learn) for building ML models and testing their accuracy.

We will try to identify which factors are present in the dataset and which factors affect flower identification more than others. For this purpose we shall be plotting violin plots and boxplots.

AFter this we will split our dataset into training and testing data points. After which we will build models based on the following algorithms and compare their accuracies:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Linear DIscriminant Analysis
3. K Nearest Neighbours
4. Decision Tree Classifier
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
6. Support Vector Machine



## RESULTS

The best accuracy we get is 96.67% from Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine algorithms.
