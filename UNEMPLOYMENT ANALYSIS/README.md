# UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS

This was the second task under the internship.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate
can be a good data science project. 


## METHODOLOGY

I have used Python library csv, pandas and numpy for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualisation, geopandas and plotly for plotting map.
First, we look over the datset to check if there are any empty points in the dataset or if there is any other discrepancy. We find out that the column names need to be renamed.
We then try to make a correlation heatmap to check the correlation between various columns of the dataset.
We make graphs relating to how many employed and unemployed people are there in each state according to region.
We then plot a map showcasing the average unemployment rate per state.

*NOTE: The states marked in white do not have any available data in the provided dataset*

## RESULTS

From the graphs and the map it is quite clear that unemployment increased in northern india at a more fast pace than the rest of the country during the year 2020.
